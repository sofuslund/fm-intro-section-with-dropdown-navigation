### What I learned

This was my first project on frontendmentor.io and it've been a long time since I last did web development so I've regained a lot of my previous knowledge about HTMl, CSS and JS. I learned a lot about responsive web design specifically the navbar and the site's layout. I also had a lot of trouble getting the images positioned and sized correctly but I've learned a lot from it.
